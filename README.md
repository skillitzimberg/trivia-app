# Trivia App

The company Tandem posted an apprenticeship position. The application included the challenge of creating a trivia app.

The instructions are in this [PDF](Tandem_SEApprentice_Challenge_2020.pdf).

I am trying to build this using TDD and incorporating Robert C. Martin's concept of clean architecture.

## USAGE

- Clone or fork the repo
- `cd` into the repo in your preffered way
- Run `npm install`
- Use Go Live (VS Code) or your preffered way of running the project in a browser. (I've just been opening the file in Chrome and refreshing when needed. And mostly it's all tests right now so not much is happening in the view.)
